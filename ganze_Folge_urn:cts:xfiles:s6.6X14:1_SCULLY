 Special Agent Dana Scully.  Out where?   What he means is I don't hear a story about a sea monster and automatically assume it's the Lord's gospel truth.  Apparently, so does Mr. Dales.  Look, Mr. Dales, I'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm. I listened to the message that you left for Agent Mulder about your friends.  In the bathroom, you said?   And you have no reason to doubt Ms. Shipley's report?  What is it that brought you out here in the first place, Mr. Dales?  At least it looks like they had the time and the presence of mind to prepare for the hurricane.  Hello! Mrs. Shipley! (MULDER walks into the laundry room area having switched to a much smaller flashlight for some reason. He sees clothes on the floor and sees slime on a pipe. Of course, he sticks his fingers in it and gets some stuck to his hand. SCULLY enters as he tries to shake the slime off his hand. Mulder... No sign of life.  How the hell did the cat get in the washing machine?  Where do you think this leads to?  (calling into the bathroom) Mr. Shipley!  Sir, we're Agents Scully and Mulder. I can show you my ba - ...  Well, what else would we be doing out here on a night like this?  (holding up her badge) Deputy...  I'll be in the car. (With a look at MULDER, she leaves the house.) (on phone) Yeah. No... Thank you. (hangs up) (MULDER enters the car and gets into the driver's seat.) Great. Mulder, they're threatening to close the airport. I think we better get out of here.  Yes, I'm curious, Mulder but I'm also suspicious. I mean, I... I think that Mr. Dales' story is fueled by more than his imagination and not much deeper than the bottom of a highball.  Because sea monsters can only be read about, Mulder, because they don't exist.  You know what? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family. (MULDER smiles at her.) Mulder, look-- there is nothing more for us to do here. There's nothing that local law enforcement can't do for us. I mean, these people are missing. There's nowhere else to look. I've done my duty for-for Mr. Dales for my conscience... I mean, haven't you?  This is an emergency.  Well, what about the airport? Is there an alternate route?  Sir, it's important that we evacuate the area. We're FBI agents and we need to get to where we're going.  I'd be happy to show you my I.D  Mulder.  (speaking loudly into her cell phone) Hello?  (on phone) Is this the Collier County Sheriff? Yes. Oh, hi. We're driving on, uh...  (on phone) Nance Road. (listens for a moment and looks pointedly at MULDER) No, it isn't very smart, is it? (MULDER squinches his faces and sarcastically imitates her nagging) No... Yes, that would be much appreciated. (to MULDER) He's going to guide us to the nearest emergency shelter.  (on phone) Hello? Hello... (hangs up in disgust) No service.  I don't need my mettle tested. (There is a loud thump as something hits the roof of their car.) What was that?  Mulder, we have to pull over. We have to wait out this storm somewhere away from the trees.  We don't know where we are and we don't know where we're going.  Deputy? Hello? Anybody... Mulder, he's in here. (DEPUTY GREER is lying on the floor gasping for air. His neck is covered in red welts.) Can you talk to me? (DEPUTY GREER begins choking.) You're having trouble breathing? This man needs a trach or he's going to die real soon. (SCULLY goes to get whatever it is she's going to need for the trach. MULDER goes into the bathroom and looks in the slimy toilet. He pulls out a man's watch.) Mulder, I need you to hold his head real steady. (MULDER is not thrilled.) Deputy, if you can hear me, just try and relax. Okay. Here we go. (MULDER holds DEPUTY GREER's head while SCULLY uses the blade on the Leatherman to cut his throat. MULDER looks away quickly. I don't know but he's having a reaction which is affecting his autonomic response.  All I know is we have to get a medivac unit out here as soon as possible.  (into DEPUTY GREER's radio) This is Special Agent Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I need a medivac unit out here ASAP.  (voice, on radio) I have an officer in need of emergency medical assistance.  (voice on radio) My name is Dana... Scully. ARTHUR DALES: (chuckling): Scully! Oh, god. (voice on radio) I'm a medical doctor requesting a medivac unit for a sheriff's deputy who is injured.  (voice on radio) I have a deputy who's been attacked by something as yet unidentified.  (voice on radio) His vitals are weak and he's in shock. Now, I need him taken to a hospital right away.  He's had some kind of foreign organism released into his body. His condition's worsening.  I don't know. It may have been some kind of a water-borne parasite.  I'm sorry. I don't know who Harry is.  He may have evacuated.  Yeah. (MULDER and SCULLY go out into the hall.) We can't.  Mulder, I just got off the radio. They won't even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time. The roads are impassable, and I don't even know if the deputy is movable in this condition.  It looks that way. At least until the weather breaks. (GEORGE is listening to them from his apartment door. He checks to make sure his gun is loaded. He is very agitated, talking to himself, pacing around the room which is decorated in Late 20th Century Disgruntled American Soldier. Lots of guns and flags.) I don't think these wounds are bites or stings. There's something in here, Mulder, right under the skin. Tongs.  Mulder, what's his temperature? 
  You're not far off. It's 106. Okay, somebody fill the tub with cold water and find as much ice as they can in the freezer.  Yeah, well, it may be but unless we get his temperature down he's not going to survive this. Now get moving. 
 We need to put this man in ice water as soon as possible. 
 I need a container. Mulder, lift him up. We have to get him into the tub. 
 All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst.  Look, you guys, whatever this thing is there's no evidence yet that it's going to kill anybody.  The man in the bathtub may very well be saved if he can just last out this storm. In fact, we may all be safe if we just remain calm.  How is he?   We'll be waiting for you out here.  Mulder, nothing I've seen convinces me there's a monster  Mulder, there is no evidence of any creature here. Those organisms might just simply be waterborne parasites, but something from Jules Verne they are not. 
 Mulder?  It's gone? 
 Where'd he go?  Mulder, if that were true then this wouldn't be visible, would it?  I mean, what this is showing us is that water actually attempts to kill it.  Mulder, the Shipleys weren't even in their house.  We're in the middle of a hurricane.  Mulder, we cant. There's no way we can transport everybody.  Mulder?  Mulder, if we're going to leave we should leave now. [ CLOSED CAPTIONING: MULDER: He took the Prowler, Scully.]
 Mulder?! Hey, Mulder, are you okay? 
 Hey... wait a second. What are you doing?!  That's my partner out there!  You can't just leave him there!  He'll die!  Well, I can at least keep him breathing!  Look, at least let me try. I'm a medical doctor.   We're going to need water. If I'm going to deliver this baby you can put that gun down.   You don't. The truth is I've never delivered a baby before. So stand back or make yourself useful but stay out of my way. 

 You got it. Breathe... Breathe. Okay, Angela, I'm going to need you to push, okay? I need you to help me help you. Okay. So let's push. 
 You got it. You got it. You're on the right track.  I'm going to need some towels, please. 
  I need some towels, damn it! 
 You're doing good. You're doing good. Okay. You're doing good. Okay. Let's go. Okay, push. 

 I can feel it up there!  Okay, come on. Puuush! Good! You got it. Okay. Here it comes.  Here it comes. It's coming. Okay. 
 It's the water.  It's the water!  Okay!  Push!  It's coming! Push! Push! 
 Okay! 
  Okay, now pick up the gun.   Pick up the gun! 
 Shoot out the sprinklers! Just point and shoot! Shoot out the sprinklers! 
 Well, it's official. Ten pounds, ten ounces of piss and vinegar. El nino grande-- Leroy Walter Villareal Suarez, Jr.  Oh, yes.  What's that?   Well, you wouldn't have known to go out in the rain if I hadn't pointed it out that to you that it was the fresh water that killed the organism...
