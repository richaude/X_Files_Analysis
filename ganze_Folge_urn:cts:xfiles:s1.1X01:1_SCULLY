 Hi. I got your message.  It's two-o-clock in the afternoon Agent Mulder.  Something you couldn't show me at work.  Which was what, exactly?  What do you mean?  What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own pilots?  Yeah, there were rumours those pilots were shot down at high altitudes, while they were routinely penetrating Russian air space.  So?  I don't get it Mulder. Does this have something to do with an X-File? I thought you only liked those, er, paranormal type cases. Am I missing something here?  You ok Mulder?  Mulder?  I checked on that file you gave me.  You failed to tell me a few things.  This isn't some UFO goose chase, you're leading me on, is it?  Are you there Mulder?  Did you hear what I said, because the bureau has it out for us already and it would make us appear pretty stupid if my field report, read like some tabloid story.  How do you mean? 
 Did you ever talk to him about this?  You know that the government is not above the law. They cannot withhold information.  How long has he been...  We'll be staying at the Beech Grove Motel if you anything, ok?  Mmm, it's called sterioptathy, it's a syndrome produced by extreme stress. POWs have been known to suffer from it, they've studied it in zoo animals.  Ever hear of something called The Aurora Project? 
 The Pentagon has all but admitted, they've been testing a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft over the western US. Maybe, these guys are flying those planes. Maybe, these guys are the washouts.  Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us, a week from Friday.  Good thing we still kept that appointment. 
 Sucker.  Catch ye outside. 
 Wanna see something weird, Mulder? Ellens Air Base isn't even on my US GS quadrant map.  You know. Where are we going?  So, what exactly were you guys doing in there?  What's that?  You believe it all, don't you?  Mulder, did you see their eyes? If I were that stoned I...  Mulder, you could have shown that kid a picture of a flying hamburger and he would have told you that's exactly what he saw.  Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs.  Mulder, c'mon. You've got two blurry photos, one of them taken almost fifty years ago, and another one, you purchased today in a roadside diner. You're going out on a pretty big limb.  Tell me, one good reason why either of these photos is authentic.  Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean I'm gonna believe they were UFOs.  Mulder, you're crazy.  And it still doesn't explain to me, what happened to Colonel Budahas. Thanks.  You ready for this.  We got a message from Mrs. Budahas, her husband came home last night. We got your message. 
 What is it?  Mulder, would you explain to me what's going on.  The brain doesn't work like that, Mulder. You can't just go in and erase certain files.  There are types of amnesia th..  All I'm saying, is that the science or medical technology to do what you are suggesting, does not exist.  Even if they could, why would they do such a thing?  It couldn't just be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse?  What the hell is th..  Federal Agents. 
 Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356, no plate registered under that number. Thanks Gayle, no no no, I'm sure the other one's bogus too, bye.  So who were those guys?  Something else.  What!  If, if that were true, it would be a national scandal.  Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply an experimental plane. Like the stealth bomber or, this Aurora Project. Doesn't the government have a right and a responsibility, to protect it's secrets?  Look, these are questions we have no business asking. Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding. Let's get out of here Mulder, while you still have a job. 
 Mulder, where are you going? 
 Yeah, I'm, I'm trying to make a call to Washington D.C. an, and I can't seem to get a long distance line.  Hello? Hello?  Excuse me. Erm, my phone's not working, can I use yours to make a credit card call, please?  This one's not working either.  Thanks. That's enough Mulder. We don't know anything. Anything more than when we got here, and that's what I gonna write in my field report. Let's get outta here Mulder, as fast as we can.
