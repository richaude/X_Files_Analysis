 Sorry for the run around. Can I buy you a drink?  It's not stopping the rest of these people. I got something to show you.  Let's get a table.  That's Colonel Robert Budahas. That photo was taken last year when he was a test pilot for the military, stationed at Ellens Air Base in Southwest Idaho. Four months ago, Colonel Budahas experienced a psychotic episode and barricaded himself in his home. Military police were called in. Budahas was removed and apparently hospitalised with treatment of his condition.  The military will not comment on the cause, nature or status. In fact, the military will not comment on Colonel Budahas at all.  Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months. Her inquiries to the military have gone unanswered. Last month, she contacted the FBI and reported it as a kidnapping.  That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question, Scully.  Since 1963, six pilots have been listed as missing in action, from Ellens Air Base. The military will say only that these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft.  There were other rumours too. I've been tracking this case since it came through the Boise regional office last month. Last week, for reasons I can't figure out, it was deprioritised. They shelved this case without an investigation, Scully.  So, you and I, are going to the spud state to investigate a little kidnapping.  Let's just say, this case has a, distinct smell to it, a certain, paranormal bouquet. Excuse me. 
 What?  Who are you?  How do you know about my work?  Who are you? Who do you work for?  I can't do that.  Yeah, I'm fine. Hello.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 
 Er, listen, I don't want to talk about it on this line. I'll, I'll talk to you about it, on the flight out, OK? 
 Mrs. Budahas?  We're from the FBI.  What kinds of things?  Did he ever talk about his work?  Eeh, you said word gets around, I'm sorry, erm, have you ever heard of this, happening to anyone else?  Mrs. McLennen, has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this?  So what did you make of Uncle Fester down the block?  Yeah, but these guys aren't zoo animals, they're test pilots. They're not supposed to fold under pressure, they're supposed to thrive on it. 
 Yeah, that's the, er, unacknowledged codename for some new kind of defence department, surveillance project.  You saw the photos on the wall in there. This guy Budahas received a presidential commodation, he's never washed out of anything in his life. 
 I've been on hold with the base director of communications for fourty-five minutes, how about you?  Yeah, right.  Did you say Kissel? Colonel Kissel?  Can I talk with you? Special Agent Mulder, FBI.  Why don't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas?  We're just looking around. 
 We're not at liberty to comment.  Paul? Right? You've lived in this area a while, you ever seen a UFO?  But, if I wanted to talk to those UFO nuts, that you refered to earlier, where would I go? Who's the photographer? 
 You're kidding, where?  Put it on my tab. 
 What would the chances be, of someone like me, seeing a UFO?  I know. Let's go.  We got our own map, sucker. 
 Were you ever chased out before?  What do you think they are?  Do they look anything like this?  Later Dude! 
 Evidence.  Kids today, huh.  Why wouldn't I? 
 Ho-hoo. If you were that stoned, what.  Alright, I wanna show you something.  This is a photo, of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now I know, you don't believe that story but just hear me out. Now, Ellens Air Base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base, that for some strange reason, doesn't appear on your US government map, is supposedly, one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.  No, planes built, using UFO technology. 
 Tell me, there isn't a remarkable resemblance.  You saw exactly what I saw in the sky tonight. What do you think they were?  Unidentified Flying Objects, I think that fits the description pretty well. Tell me I'm crazy.  You didn't come to raid my mini-bar, did ye?  What?  Mrs. Budahas, are you ok?  What? What's wrong? 
 It's ok, it's ok, just relax, wel, I'm Special Agent Mulder, from the FBI. We're out here investigating your disappearance Colonel Budahas. Wondering if you have any explanation of your whereabouts over the past four months.  Here, on base?  Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birthdate?  And the names of your kids?  Green Bay fan.  Bet you remember the Superbowl of 68, huh? Don Shandler.  Colonel, Colonel Budahas, you're a, a pilot, isn't that right?  Bet you've flown just about everything with two wings. I got this hotshot pilot friend, who said that he could do Immelmann at a sustained eight g's, huh, is that possible?  I think they re-wired that man's brain. Some kind of selective memory drain.  Then you explain it to me.  This is not amnesia, I think it's something far more deliberate and insidious.  And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we saw last night. Listen to me Scully, they can do this. That man, he should have known the answer to the question, it just wasn't in his head anymore. 
 To control information. I think that after his psychotic episode, Colonel Budahas became a security risk.  No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas are physiologically incapable of dealing with the stress of flying the aircraft we saw. Or doing those manoeuvres, at those speeds. I mean we're talking about a technology that is so sensitive and advanced, that it's taken almost fifty years to make it work. UFO technology, Scully. 
 Hold on. 
 You think if maybe we ignore him, he'll go away? 
 Guess not.  Special Agent Mulder, FBI. 
 You wanna tell me what this is about. 
 I don't think it was those kids they were chasing away from the base last night, I think it was us. They knew we were coming before we ever arrived. And they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy. There's something I didn't tell you, Scully.  I was approached by a man in D.C. who warned me to stay away from this case, he didn't give me his name, and my phone was being tapped.  Why would they go to all this trouble? Out of a need for security. Security of what? I think there's a huge conspiracy here Scully. They've got a UFO here, I'm sure of it. And they'll do anything to keep it a secret, including sacrificing lives and minds of those pilots, because what if that secret got out.  No no, you're not thinking big enough, if it were true, it would be confirmation of the existence of extra terrestrial life.  Yes, but at what cost, when does the human cost become too high for the building of a better machine?  Aren't you even curious?  Aaerm, I gonna shower, I'll pack and then, we'll get outta here. 
 Hey, aren't you guys coming?  Ok, this spot you told me about where you watch the air show, how far is it?  Will I be able to find it?  And what about this other place you told me about, Yellow Base, where they hangar them.  Nooo. 
 Hi.  We came by to see how your husband was doing.  Do you think, maybe, we could see him.  They got to her Scully. They were here, they must have threatened her and Budahas..  Why?  I saw something I...  What is your interest?  I did see something, but it's gone, they took it from me, they erased it. You have to tell me what it was.  Because, all the evidence to the contrary, is not entirely dissuasive.  They're here, aren't they?
