 Mr. Dales, there's a reason that people don't head out into hurricanes.  Mr. Dales, can we come in?  She's my partner. 
  Yes, but she's... she's not the type that's easily persuaded.  Well, she knows your reputation your early work on the X-Files and she has a knack for getting to the bottom of things. 
 It was your description that caused Agent Scully's...  dubiousness.  She's missing, too?  It's not a night that anybody should be out in.  Hello! Mrs. Shipley!  Got the place all boarded up. It's from the inside. It makes you wonder how they got out.  There's something on the drainpipe. I can't get it off. (They look up quickly as the washing machine lid rises then falls again. They slowly walk toward it. SCULLY holds big flashlight as MULDER picks up a mop.) I don't know if I'm going to need my gun or a harpoon here. (MULDER cautiously approaches the washing machine and uses the stick to barely lift the lid. They both yelp as REGGIE THE CAT, very wet, leaps out of the machine and runs outside into the rain.) Maybe he was taking a dip... After he finished boarding up the windows. (They walk farther into the house and find a picture of the family and an interior door completely boarded up.) Must be the bathroom. Dales told me the wife told him that the... the husband was grabbed from the bathroom. (MULDER puts his flashlight in his mouth and begins pulling boards off the door.) (flashlight in his mouth) Can you give me a hand with this? (SCULLY puts her small flashlight in her mouth and begins helping MULDER. They are startled by DEPUTY GREER, a heavyset small town sheriff's deputy, who enters holding a gun on them. MULDER and SCULLY turn, hands in the air, flashlights still in their mouths. Very funny.) You can put the gun down. We're FBI.  We're out here like you. We're...  We're out here looking for the Shipleys, too.  Arthur Dales called us.  Does that name mean anything to you? Arthur Dales?  All right.  No, I'm not, but I'd like to.  No, no, no. Not before you help me finish what you interrupted.  Come on. (DEPUTY GREER and MULDER begin taking boards off the door.).(Later, SCULLY is outside in the car on her cell phone. She is speaking loudly to be heard over the storm.) No one in the bathroom. The deputy helped me pull off the plywood. There's no sign of anything except more of that slime in the bathtub and maybe three inches of water on the floor. It's weird. It's like somebody left the taps running before they boarded up the door.  Aren't you even curious what happened to these people?  Don't dismiss him so easily. He discovered the X-Files 40 years ago. He's seen things that I've only read about.  (in nature documentary narrator voice) If the sea is where life began-- where our ancestors first walked ashore-- then who's to say what new life may be developing in its uncharted depths.  (slight pout) Well, we should at least tell him that we're giving up... shouldn't we? (Helpless, SCULLY gives him a look.)(Inside the house, DEPUTY GREER continues to look around alone.) What's the problem, officer?   Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate the concern. 
 I was just one howdy do over the line. 
 The good thing about zero visibility, Scully? Can't get any worse.  Nance Road... N-A-N-C-E Road.  (ready to be out of the car) Not a moment too soon.  You know, Scully, someday we're going to look back on this and we're going to laugh. We'll just think of it as, uh... you know man pitted against the forces of nature. Think of it as a test of our mettle.  I think that was a-a tree branch. Debris is starting to fly.  We're not going to dodge any trees in a parked car. At least if we're driving, we're a moving target.  (looking out the window) There's somebody, I think who's about to give us directions. Who says there's never a cop when you need one? (MULDER pulls into the Breakers Condominium's parking lot beside DEPUTY GREER's flashing vehicle. They get out the car and enter the garage area.) : SCULLY: Mulder, isn't that... MULDER: Forrest Gump. [Closed captioning said: Yup. Sherlock's patrol car.](They enter the complex and find the manager's open door.) (to himself) I've heard of passing the time... Ouch. (SCULLY returns to her patient. She has his Leatherman and a ball point pen cap in her mouth.) Looks like he was attacked or stung. (looking at marks) What are those?  Whatever it was, I think it came through the plumbing, through the toilet.  If it's in the plumbing I got to make sure nobody else is in this building. (MULDER goes back out into the hall.) Excuse me, sir. Is everything okay in your apartment?  Do you need some help... with your television? (A few doors down the hall, WALTER SUAREZ comes out into the hall.) No. Do you need medical help?  Who's we? Who are you talking about?  You don't know this man, mister...?  Yeah. Everything in your pockets, too. (DOUGIE THE LOOTER carries the television back into the apartment.) Mulder. (MULDER enter the apartment and sees a VERY pregnant ANGELA VILLAREAL sitting on the couch. Lots of candles are on the table.) Stay there, Mrs. Suarez. We're going to make sure your baby makes it safely into the world.  Walter, Angela... I'm going to have to ask you to leave your apartment and come downstairs with me.  Right now, I just want to get you someplace where I know you'll be safe.  I don't know but it may have seriously injured a sheriff's deputy.  In the manager's apartment. It could be in the complex's plumbing now.  (to WALTER) Kid's going to be a fighter. (WALTER laughs nervously) Anybody else in the complex that you know of?  George?  He's going to want to listen to me.  It's for you. (Later, MULDER knocks at another door.) Mr. Vincent! George Vincent!  I'm a federal agent, Mr. Vincent. I'm asking you to open the door.  Mr. Vincent, your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your apartment.  Well, that's great. But you may not be armed for what it is I'm talking about.  All the nuts roll down to Florida. (Inside manager's apartment. WALTER and ANGELA have joined SCULLY. SCULLY covers DEPUTY GREER with a blanket.) Scully, can I talk to you for a second?  We got to out of here as soon as possible.  We can put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital.  You mean we're stuck here?  Well, either he's got no temperature or he's about to spontaneously combust.  Mr. Vincent? 
 Drop your weapon! Put it down!'  You didn't see it?  That looks like the four- inch tie-in to the second floor. Whatever it is didn't just rip through the ceiling. Looks like it ripped right through the pipe.  I don't know. It must still be in the building. It's probably in the outflow system.  Someone's already got him by the nugs.  Scully, that's how this thing is here. The hurricane is sitting offshore dredging up god knows what and this thing must have been driven into the city's reclamation system through some offshore outfall pipe. From there it gained access to the sewer pipes in this building.  Scully, something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the ocean-- something that had been lying there undiscovered for ages, probably.  He's gone.  No. He's gone. The deputy.  I think the deputy went out with the bathwater.  No, I don't think he was.  I'm sure she did. Look, Scully, I think I know why nobody's ever seen this thing before. It, it just doesn't live in water. It is water, taking shape only when it attacks, like it did when the hurricane backed seawater into the plumbing. Virtually unseeable until then.  Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process. Maybe it needs time to complete its cycle like it had with the Shipleys.  No, they were when they were attacked just like the deputy was here-- using their bodies to lay its own spawn-- using the body's water content to reproduce itself-- to make itself anew.  We got to get out of here.  We got to get to another building.  We can use the deputy's Prowler. How many people? We got two, four...  son of a bitch.  Yeah?   Oh, no.  She didn't save my life, really...  No. No no no no I-I saw the Shipley's cat.  I saw the cat, which had been saved which had been in the washing machine. And the Shipleys had boarded up their house which means that the only way they could have vanished was if the creature came up through the plumbing in a backwash of seawater seawater. And then the deputy who vanished from a bathtub full of Epsom salts.
